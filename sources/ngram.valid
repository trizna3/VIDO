__label__11 @mmpadellan @HowmanyTimesDo3 Coronavirus test in US is $3,000. Here in Tokyo it’s $50, $166 without State ins. In much of Europe it’s free  Worse, in much of the US, it’s not even available, unreliable. And meanwhile #POTUS recently called Corona one big “hoax.”  USA: 1st world $$$, 3rd world healthcare. https://t.co/COs1zH1RvQ

__label__11 Could this be reason why #coronavirus has spread in north Italy? The timing of the Qatar Airways flight QR127 (777) is 2 hours after the 777 arrives from Tehran (QR491). Qatar has used the same 777 to go to Milan after the Tehran trip several times in past month, as last night https://t.co/VmbfEbwt0u
